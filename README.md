# 🐾 Gremlins After Midnight

**When the clock strikes 12, Cat City changes forever.**  
Gremlins swarm the streets and alleyways, forcing the once-proud feline citizens to retreat, regroup, and strategize. This AI-driven simulation models the ongoing struggle between clever cats and chaotic gremlins.

## 📖 Description

**Gremlins After Midnight** is a simulation project (with some game-like mechanics) built around AI and decision-making logic. It explores predator-evader behavior through the lens of adorable but cunning cats versus mischievous gremlins.  
Expect neural nets, some fuzzy logic, and a sprinkle of chaos theory.

## 🚀 Features

- 🧠 AI-based behavior trees for cat and gremlin decision-making
- 🔄 Day/Night cycle simulation (Midnight is *very* important)
- 🗺️ Grid-based map of Cat City with dynamic hazards and safe zones
- 💡 Pathfinding using A* and Dijkstra
- 🧬 Basic machine learning model for pattern recognition
- 🐈‍⬛ Retreat planning module for cats using reinforcement learning
- 🧪 Simulation control and visual output via CLI or web dashboard

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Languages**: Python, JavaScript
- **Frameworks**: Flask (for dashboard), PyTorch (for ML), D3.js (for visualization)
- **Libraries**: NumPy, Pandas, NetworkX, Scikit-learn
